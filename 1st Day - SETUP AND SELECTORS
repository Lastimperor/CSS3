- Intro to CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page.

- Inline Styles

it's possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.
To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. 
After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element.

<p style="color: red;">I'm learning to code!</p>

Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon (;).

- The <style> Tag

HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element.
To use the <style> element, it must be placed inside of the <head> element.

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>

- The .css file

Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML and CSS code in separate files

You can create a CSS file by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css

- Linking the CSS File

You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together. 
The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. 
It is a self-closing tag and requires three attributes:

href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.

type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). 
The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.

rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. 
Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
