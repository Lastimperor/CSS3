- CSS Structure

To style an HTML element using CSS, you need to write a CSS declaration inside the body of a CSS selector.

h1 {
  color: blue;
}

'color: blue' is referred to as a CSS declaration. CSS declarations consist of a property and a value.

Property — the property you'd like to style of that element (i.e., size, color, etc.).

Value — the value of the property (i.e., 18px for size, blue for color, etc.).

The property and value are separated by a colon (:). A semicolon (;) should always be used at the end of a declaration.

- Font Family

Font refers to the technical term typeface, or font family.

To change the typeface of text on your web page, you can use the font-family property.

h1 {
  font-family: Garamond;
}

keep the following points in mind:

1. The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user's computer in order for that font to display when a user visits the web page.
2.The default typeface for all HTML elements is Times New Roman.
3. It's a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3
4. When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, it's a best practice to enclose the typeface's name in quotes, like so:

h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New";
}

- Font Size

To change the size of text on your web page, you can use the font-size property.

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

- Font Weight

In CSS, the font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears.

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}

The font-weight property has a another value: normal, essentially shutting off bold for that element.


- Text Align

No matter how much styling is applied to text (typeface, size, weight, etc.), text always appears on the left side of the browser.

To align text we can use the text-align property. 
The text-align property will align text to the element that holds it, otherwise known as its parent.

h1 {
  text-align: right;
}

The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:

left — aligns text to the left hand side of its parent element, which in this case is the browser.
center — centers text inside of its parent element.
right — aligns text to the right hand side of its parent element.

- Color

it's important to make two distinctions about color. 

Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. 
For example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground color of the heading has been styled.

Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled.

In CSS, these two design aspects can be styled with the following two properties:

color: this property styles an element's foreground color
background-color: this property styles an element's background color

h1 {
  color: red;
  background-color: blue;
}

- Opacity

Opacity is the measure of how transparent an element is. 
It's measured from 0 to 1, with 1 representing 100%, or fully visible and opaque, and 0 representing 0%, or fully invisible.

.overlay {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

- Background Image

This is done through the CSS property background-image. 

.main-banner {
  background-image: url("https://www.example.com/image.jpg");
}

The background-image property will set the element's background to display an image.
The value provided to background-image is a url or a path.
If there was an image folder in the project, with an image named mountains.jpg, the relative file path would look like:

.main-banner {
  background-image: url("images/mountains.jpg");
}
