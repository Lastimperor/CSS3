- Introduction to Grids

The grid can be used to lay out entire web pages. 
Whereas Flexbox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, 
CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts, providing many tools for aligning and moving elements across both rows and columns.

- Creating a Grid

To set up a grid, you need to have both a grid container and grid items. 
The grid container will be a parent element that contains grid items as children and applies overarching styling and positioning to them.

To turn an HTML element into a grid container, 
you must set the elementâ€™s display property to grid (for a block-level grid) or inline-grid (for an inline grid). 
Then, you can assign other properties to lay out the grid.
