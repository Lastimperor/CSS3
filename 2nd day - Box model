- Introduction to the Box Model

an important concept to understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website.

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as "living" inside of a box. 
This is what is meant by the box model.

- The Box Model

The box model comprises the set of properties which define parts of an element that take up space on a web page.

The properties include:

Width and height — specifies the width and height of the content area.
Padding — specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.
Border — specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.
Margin — specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.

- Height and Width

An element's content has two dimensions: a height and a width. 
By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box.

The CSS height and width properties can be used to modify these default dimensions.

p {
  height: 80px;
  width: 240px;
}


- Borders

A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. 
Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.

width — The thickness of the border. 
A border's thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, or thick.

style — The design of the border. 
Web browsers can render any of 10 different styles. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, and solid.

color — The color of the border. 
Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including 140 built-in color keywords.

p {
  border: 3px solid coral;
}

The default border is medium none color, where color is the current color of the element.

- Border Radius

Thanks to CSS, a border doesn't have to be square.

You can modify the corners of an element's border box with the border-radius property.

div.container {
  border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);
  border-radius: 5px;
}

You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the height of the box, or to 100%.

- Padding I

The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding. 
In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.

p.content-header {
  border: 3px solid coral;
  padding: 10px;
}

The code in this example puts 10 pixels of space between the content of the paragraph (the text) and the borders, on all four sides.
The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make content look less cramped.

If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box's content, you can use the following properties:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
