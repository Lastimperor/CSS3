typography, the art of arranging text on a page. 
With css I can style fonts to make them legible and appealing and how to add external fonts to your web pages.

- Font Family

To change the typeface of text on your web page, you can use the font-family property.

h1 {
  font-family: Garamond;
}

When setting typefaces on a web page, keep the following points in mind:

1) The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user’s computer in order for that font to display.

2) The default typeface for all most browsers is Times New Roman. 
You may be familiar with this typeface if you have ever used a formatted word processor.

3) It’s a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3.

4) When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, it must be enclosed in double quotes 
(otherwise it will not be recognized), like so:

h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New";
}

- Font Weight

It’s common to bold important headings or keywords. In CSS, we can style bold text with the font-weight property.

If we want to bold text in a web page, we can set the font-weight to bold.

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}

If we want to ensure that text is not bold, we can set the font-weight to normal.

p {
  font-weight: normal;
}

By default, the font-weight of most text elements is set to normal. 
Some elements, like headers, have built-in bold styling. 
A good approach is to check to see if the the text element has any default styling, and use the font-weight property accordingly.

- Font Weight II

The font-weight property can also be assigned a number value to style text on a numeric scale ranging from 100 to 900. 
Valid values are multiples of 100 within this range such as 200 or 500.

When using numeric weights, there are a number of default font weights that we can use:

400 is the default font-weight of most text.
700 signifies a bold font-weight.
300 signifies a light font-weight.

header {
  font-weight: 800;
}

footer {
  font-weight: 200;
}

Here, the header would appear as a deep bold, while the footer would appear rather light.

It’s important to note that not all fonts can be assigned a numeric font-weight. 
You can look up the font you are using to see which font-weight values are available.

- Font Style

You can also italicize text with the font-style property.

h3 {
  font-style: italic;
}

The italic value causes text to appear in italics. 
The font-style property also has a normal value which is the default.

- Word Spacing

You can also increase the spacing between words in a body of text, technically known as word spacing.

To do so, you can use the word-spacing property:

h1 {
  word-spacing: 0.3em;
}

The default amount of space between words is usually 0.25em.

- Letter Spacing

he technical term for adjusting the spacing between letters is called “kerning”. 
Kerning can be adjusted with the letter-spacing property in CSS.

h1 {
  letter-spacing: 0.3em;
}

Like word spacing, it’s not common to increase the kerning in text, but sometimes it enhances the readability of uppercase text.

- Text Transformation

Text can also be styled to appear in either all uppercase or lowercase with the text-transform property.

h1 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

- Text Alignment

No matter how much styling is applied to text (typeface, size, weight, etc.), text always appears on the left side of the browser.

To move, or align, text, we can use the text-align property.

h1 {
  text-align: right;
}

The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:

left - aligns text to the left hand side of the browser.
center - centers text.
right - aligns text to the right hand side of the browser.

- Line Height Anatomy

Another property that we can set for text is line-height. This property modifies the leading of text.

line height = leading + font size

- Line Height

We can use the line-height property to set how tall we want the line containing our text to be, regardless of the height of the text. 
Line heights can take one of several values:

A unitless number, such as 1.2. This number is an absolute value that will compute the line height as a ratio of the font size.
A number specified by unit, such as 12px. This number can be any valid CSS unit, such as pixels, percents, ems, or rems.
Generally, the unitless ratio value is the preferred method, since it is responsive and based exclusively on the current font size. 

if we change the font size, a unitless line-height would automatically readjust, whereas the pixel value would remain static.

p {
  line-height: 1.4;
}

- Serif and Sans Serif

Serif — fonts that have extra details on the ends of each letter. 
Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others.

Sans-Serif — fonts that do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. 
Instead, letters have straight, flat edges, like Arial or Helvetica.

- Fallback Fonts

Most computers have a small set of typefaces pre-installed. 
This small set includes serif fonts like Times New Roman and sans-serif fonts like Arial.

These pre-installed fonts serve as fallback fonts if the stylesheet specifies a font which is not installed on a user’s computer.

To use fallback fonts, the following syntax is required:

h1 {
  font-family: "Garamond", "Times", serif;
}

The CSS rule above says:

Use the Garamond font for all <h1> elements on the web page.
If Garamond is not available, use the Times font.
If Garamond and Times are not available, use any serif font pre-installed on the user’s computer.

- Linking Fonts I

New fonts are often centralized in directories made available for public use. We refer to these fonts as non-user fonts.

Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts, available for free use. 
Google Fonts gives a way to retrieve the link for a single and multiple fonts, or multiple fonts with the font-weight and font-style properties.

- Linking Fonts II

When we have the link to the font of our choice, we can add the font to the <head> section of the HTML document, using the <link> tag and the href.

Let’s take a look at a few examples:

1. A single linked font, using Droid Serif as an example:

<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

2. Multiple linked fonts, using the Droid Serif and Playfair Display fonts as an example:

<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif|Playfair+Display" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

3. Multiple linked fonts, along with weights and styles. Here Droid Serif has font weights of 400, 700, and 700i, while Playfair Display has font weights of 400, 700, and 900i:

<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif:400,700,700i|Playfair+Display:400,700,900i" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

Once a font is linked, we can create CSS selectors to target elements, just as we do with other fonts.

- Linking Fonts III

Check min.10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0

In a css file I can write:

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif:400,700,700i')

- Font-Face I

There are other ways to link non-user fonts that don’t require the use of the <link> tag in the HTML document. 
CSS offers a way to import fonts directly into stylesheets with the @font-face property.

To load fonts with the @font-face property:

1) Instead of using the font’s link in the HTML document, enter the link into the URL bar in the browser.
2) The browser will load the CSS rules. You will need to focus on the rules that are directly labeled as /* latin */. 
   Some of the latin rules are on separate lines. You will need each of these.
   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Space+Mono:400,700 here, the /* latn */ section are two.
3) Copy each of the CSS rules labeled latin, and paste the rules from the browser to the top of style.css.

It is important to stress the need to copy the @font-face rules to the top of the stylesheet for the font to load correctly in the project.

We can modify our @font-face rule to use local font files as well. 
We can supply the user with the desired font family and host it along with our site instead of depending on a different site.

@font-face {
  font-family: "Roboto";
  src: url(fonts/Roboto.woff2) format('woff2'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.woff) format('woff'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.tff) format('truetype');
}

- Font-Face II

Here, you’ll notice:

The main difference is the use of a relative filepath instead of a web URL.

We add a format for each file to specify which font to use. 
Different browsers support different font types, so providing multiple font file options will support more browsers.

As of now .woff2 appears to be the way of the future, due to greatly reduced file sizes and improved performance, 
but many browsers still don’t support it.
There are lots of great sources to find fonts to use locally, such as Font Squirrel.
